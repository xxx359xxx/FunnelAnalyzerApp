# GitHub Upload Instructions

## Step 1: Create a New Repository on GitHub

1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and sign in to your account

   - **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
5. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Connect Your Local Repository

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands. Use these in your terminal:

```bash
# Add the remote origin (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)

# Rename the default branch to main (if needed)
